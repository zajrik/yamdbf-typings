# [YAMDBF](https://github.com/zajrik/yamdbf) Typings
# Typings have been merged into the YAMDBF package and should no longer need to be installed separately. Your editor should be able to pick them up automatically. :ok_hand:

Should be up to date with the latest YAMDBF version. I might actually be moving the framework from JS to TS eventually so the typings can be generated automatically and I won't have to worry about keeping it up to date.

# Installation
To install the most up to date version, use:
```
typings install github:zajrik/yamdbf-typings/yamdbf.d.ts --save --global
```

To prevent pulling in potentially breaking changes, include a specific commit:
```
typings install github:zajrik/yamdbf-typings/yamdbf.d.ts#63640780777dfb85bfc3d0b7188c3be1dcf539d9 --save --global
```
